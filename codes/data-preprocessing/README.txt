Updated July 31, 2017 by Yihan Zhang

*** The data is for the use of this data analysis project only. It is preprocessed and simplified. *Do not distribute!*

*** To access the raw data, please go to http://wilmabainbridge.com/facememorability2.html.

------------------------------

To generate the preprocessed data, run the R script preprocess.R with psychology-attribute.mat and image-labels.csv present. It will create four .mat files of the preprocessed data in the same directory.

The preprocessed data are output in .mat format in collaboration with other researchersâ€™ work.
